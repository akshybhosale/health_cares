                                                        Getting Started with Create A Health Cares App By using following steps
                                                        This project was bootstrapped with Reactjs framework.
                                                        
                                                        Available Scripts
                                                        In the project directory, you can run:
                                                        
                                                        git init
                                                        git clone https://github.com/akshybhosale/health_cares
                                                        
                                                        Install a npm packages and Material UI bootstrapped packages
                                                        npm start
                                                        Runs the app in the development mode.
                                                        Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
                                                        
                                                        npm run build
                                                        Builds the app for production to the build folder.
                                                        It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
                                                        
                                                        The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
