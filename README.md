                                     Getting Started with Create A Health Cares App By using following steps
                                     This project was bootstrapped with Reactjs framework.
                                     
                                     Available Scripts
                                     In the project directory, you can run:
                                     
                                     git init
                                     git clone https://github.com/akshybhosale/health_cares
                                     
                                     Install a npm packages and Material UI bootstrapped packages
                                     npm start
                                     Runs the app in the development mode.
                                     Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
                                     
                                     npm run build
                                     Builds the app for production to the build folder.
                                     It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
                                     
                                     The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
                                     Your app is ready to be deployed!
